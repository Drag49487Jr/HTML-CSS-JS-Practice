### DOM Manipulation, and Setting up a Project

<h1>Objectives</h1>
<ul>
    <li>[ ] Clone this repository to your local machine. There is no need to fork this repository before you clone it</li>
    <li>[ ] Connect to an external CSS & JS file from <code>index.html</code></li>
    <li>[ ] Create four <code>div</code> elements, and style them so that they are four different colors (use CSS to  present them aesthetically on the page)</li>
    <li>[ ] Create four on click event functions. Each function should change a different aspect of each <code>div</code> (change the color of a <code>div</code> , change the text of a <code>div</code> , and make a <code>div</code> disappear. For the last <code>div</code> use your imagination! (feel free to make these changes with a <code>button</code>, or by clicking/ hovering over the element itself )</li>
    <li>[ ] ***BONUS*** Set up a github repository, and make commits has you go (use proper comments)</li> 
    <li>[ ] ***BONUS*** Create a <code>development</code> branch, and merge to master as you go</li> 
</ul>
